# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

1---> **The objective was to enhance underwater mine detection by integrating SONAR technology with
machine learning, enabling real-time identification and classification of mines to improve maritime
safety and reduce risks.**

2---> **It includes SONAR data collection, preprocessing, and classification using machine learning models
trained to differentiate between mines and other underwater objects, followed by evaluation and realtime
detection integration.**
